# Ulima
This final project, created by Anuluxmy, Clare, Dora and Kate, is a Machine Learning project written in Python.
We wanted to use the childrens game Connect 4 to investigate how machine learning could be used to mimic human behaviour.

## Motivation
In our final project the team wanted to meet a number of personal goals. 
These were the following:
- Gain an understanding of `Machine Learning` sufficiently to create a working model
- Code entirely in a new language, for which we chose `Python`
- Consistently work using key `Agile` concepts:
  - User Stories
  - Daily checking in with Standups & Retros
  - Incremental development
- To fully understand `Continous Developments/Continuous Integration` 
- For all of our code to be created using `Test Driven Development` best practices
- To ensure that we write clean,m extendable code by linting the code before each commit
- To use `GitHub` to manage our development environment
- To fully document our process, out learning and the outcome
- And finally to create an informative and entertaining presentation
