# Ulima
This final project, created by Anuluxmy, Clare, Dora and Kate, is a Machine Learning project written in Python.
We wanted to use the childrens game Connect 4 to investigate how machine learning could be used to mimic human behaviour.

## Motivation
In our final project the team wanted to meet a number of personal goals. 
These were the following:
- Gain an understanding of `Machine Learning` sufficiently to create a working model
- Code entirely in a new language, for which we chose `Python`
- Consistently work using key `Agile` concepts:
  - User Stories
  - Daily checking in with Standups & Retros
  - Incremental development
- To fully understand `Continous Developments/Continuous Integration` 
- For all of our code to be created using `Test Driven Development` best practices
- To ensure that we write clean,m extendable code by linting the code before each commit
- To use `GitHub` to manage our development environment
- To fully document our process, out learning and the outcome
- And finally to create an informative and entertaining presentation

## Features
What makes your project stand out?

## Code Example
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Installation
Provide step by step series of examples and explanations about how to get a development env running.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests
We used pytest to feature test the code we borrowwed and to unit test the code we wrote.
To run pytest we ...
